## KASAN for ARM

KASAN (Kernel Address SANitizer, the kernel implementation of an [existing
userspace aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer)) for 32-bit ARM
is not yet in mainline Linux, but [v6 of a
series adding support](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190617221134.9930-1-f.fainelli@gmail.com/)
was posted in mid-2019. As part of tracking down squashfs decompression errors
in OpenBMC I took v6 for a test drive. Ultimately it didn't help my cause, but
I had some fun debugging KASAN along the way.

The immediately obvious issue from the first run of the patches was that
enabling KASAN caused a failure to boot, before any useful output had made it
to the console. Failures like this are sometimes masked by the fact that the
kernel won't produce output until the UART driver is bound to the console
device, but this is a well recognised issue and we have the `EARLY_PRINTK`
Kconfig option to help deal with it. Turning on `DEBUG_LL` and `EARLY_PRINTK`
restrict the kernel to a single UART definition and the resulting kernel isn't
portable, so the options are sometimes avoided in defconfigs.

The following config snippet will build support for the early console on ASPEED
BMCs into the kernel:

```
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_UART_8250=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_PHYS=0x1e784000
CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_VIRT=0xf8184000
```

However, configuring the kernel this way didn't change the result - there was
still no output with KASAN enabled and so it was time for another approach.

As KASAN is largely hardware independent (though in some cases it can take
advantage of hardware assistance) I was testing the builds using the
witherspoon-bmc machine model from [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org). Helpfully,
QEMU can provide assistance to `gdb` through a couple of commandline switches:

```
$ qemu-system-arm -h | grep -- '-[sS] '
-S              freeze CPU at startup (use 'c' to start execution)
-s              shorthand for -gdb tcp::1234
$ qemu-system-arm \
	-M witherspoon-bmc \
	-m 512 \
	-kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage \
	-dtb arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed-bmc-opp-witherspoon.dtb \
	-initrd rootfs.cpio.xz \
	-nographic \
	-s -S 
...
```

Using the two switches in concert we can debug the kernel by catching the CPU
before the first instruction, attaching a remote `gdb` session for the kernel
and setting some appropriate breakpoints. We know that we're not getting any
output from the kernel on the console, so the issue is before the first
`printk()` succeeds. The first line of output for ARM kernels looks like:

```
[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0
```

And this line is output from [`smp_setup_processor_id()` in
`arch/arm/kernel/setup.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/kernel/setup.c?h=v5.4#n585).

Returning to `gdb`, we invoke it from inside the kernel source tree against the
`vmlinux` binary and set it up to connect to the running QEMU instance:

```
$ gdb-multiarch vmlinux
...
(gdb) target remote :1234
Remote debugging using :1234
0x80000000 in ?? ()
(gdb) break smp_setup_processor_id
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80900d40: smp_setup_processor_id. (2 locations)
(gdb) continue
...
```

Setting a breakpoint in `smp_setup_processor_id()` eventually revealed that the
`printk()` itself was the problem, and it was a problem because we were blowing
the stack due to `memcpy()` calling itself recursively as a result of creative
KASAN implementation details.

With a patch to fix the recursive `memcpy()` (1) and another to fix
false-positive KASAN warnings in both `__copy_to_user_memcpy()` and
`__clear_user_memset()` (2), I got QEMU to cleanly boot the kernel and start
userspace. KASAN didn't end up providing the smoking gun I was hoping for to
root-cause the problem of squashfs decompression failures, but it did at least
rule out that bad kernel memory accesses were the source of the problem.
